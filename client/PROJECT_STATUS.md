**ESLint Configuration Fixed for TypeScript Strict Mode Alignment**

Successfully resolved ESLint configuration issues that were creating technical debt through inappropriate `any` → `unknown` type replacements. The problem was ESLint rules conflicting with TypeScript's strict mode compiler settings.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ **Root Cause Identified**: ESLint auto-fixes were replacing legitimate `any` types with `unknown`, breaking dynamic content handling
- ✅ **Configuration Balanced**: Updated client/eslint.config.js with warning-level TypeScript rules that align with strict compiler mode
- ✅ **Legitimate Usage Preserved**: Confirmed proper handling of:
  - JSON schema objects (dynamic traversal)
  - Test data generation (runtime type checking)
  - SSE/WebSocket event payloads (variable message structures)
  - Dynamic assessment results (flexible response handling)
- ✅ **Technical Debt Prevention**: ESLint now warns about `any` usage without blocking legitimate cases
- ✅ **Build Compatibility**: Configuration works with TypeScript's `"strict": true` mode

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `/home/bryan/dashboard/client/eslint.config.js`
- Set TypeScript rules to `"warn"` level instead of `"off"` or `"error"`
- Removed type-checking rules that require project configuration
- Maintained educational value while preventing build-breaking auto-fixes

**Result**: ESLint now guides better typing practices without creating technical debt or breaking dynamic content functionality.
