**MCP Dashboard JSON View State Persistence Fix - Complete UI Stability Implementation**

Successfully resolved all remaining JSON view state persistence issues, achieving complete UI stability for the Tools Tab JSON display interface:

**‚úÖ Major State Persistence Fixes:**

1. **View Mode Switching Issue Resolution** - Fixed "Formatted" button jumping back to "Raw":
   - Root cause: ViewMode state using React useState which resets to default on SSE re-renders
   - Solution: Extended global state manager (jsonExpansionStore) to handle view mode persistence
   - Implementation: Added viewModes Map and getViewMode/setViewMode methods to global store
   - Result: View mode selection now persists across Server-Sent Event updates

2. **Global State Manager Enhancement** - Expanded jsonExpansionStore capabilities:
   - Added viewModes Map to store view mode state outside React component lifecycle
   - Created getViewMode() and setViewMode() methods with console logging for debugging
   - Updated clearAll() and clearInstance() methods to include view mode cleanup
   - Per-instance storage ensures different JsonView components maintain separate states

3. **JsonView Component State Migration** - Converted from local to global state management:
   - Replaced useState for viewMode with jsonExpansionStore.getViewMode() access
   - Added handleViewModeChange() callback to update global state and trigger re-renders
   - Updated button click handlers to use new callback instead of direct setState
   - Modified conditional rendering to use currentViewMode from global store

4. **Complete UI Stability Achievement** - Resolved progressive state persistence issues:
   - **Session 1**: Fixed raw JSON expansion state collapse ‚Üí ‚úÖ Working
   - **Session 2**: Fixed formatted view expansion state collapse ‚Üí ‚úÖ Working
   - **Session 3**: Fixed view mode switching (Raw/Formatted toggle) ‚Üí ‚úÖ Working
   - **Current State**: All JSON view state fully persistent across SSE updates

**üîß Technical Implementation Details:**
- Global singleton state manager exists outside React lifecycle preventing SSE reset issues
- Per-instance state storage using unique instanceId allows multiple JsonView components
- Force re-render mechanism ensures immediate UI updates when global state changes
- Consistent pattern applied to both expansion states and view mode selection

**üìä Complete State Persistence Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Raw JSON Expansion**: Node expansion/collapse states persist across re-renders
- ‚úÖ **Formatted Text Expansion**: Long text expansion states persist across re-renders
- ‚úÖ **View Mode Selection**: Raw/Formatted toggle selection persists across re-renders
- ‚úÖ **SSE Compatibility**: All states survive Server-Sent Event triggered component updates
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Instance Support**: Different tool results maintain separate state isolation

**üéØ User Experience Improvements:**
- No more automatic collapse when expanding JSON content in Tools Tab
- View mode stays selected when switching between Raw and Formatted display
- Consistent behavior across all tool execution results and JSON displays
- Professional UI behavior matching user expectations for persistent interface state

**üöÄ Production Ready JSON Interface:**
- Complete state persistence system handles all UI stability scenarios
- Global state management pattern ready for application to other components
- Enhanced debugging with console logging for state changes and transitions
- Dashboard running successfully at http://localhost:6286/ with full functionality
